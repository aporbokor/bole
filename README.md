Bole is an interactive simulation/visualization of single-winner voting systems.

* **Robust:** Bole is able to simulate elections in real time as the environment is changing. It provides a way to adjust parameters (voter/candidate count, tactical voter chance, approval/support range, etc.) on the fly, giving the user total control.
* **Educational:** For those interested in the way of voting, it provides a boundless environment in which during experimentation, one can get a deep understanding about the different voting systems, their advantages and disadvantages.
* **Dynamic:** It gives an opportunity for the curious to automatize the process of voting method analysis by running multiple elections with the environment regenerated each time, remembering the outcomes, and (possibly) testing against given criterions.
