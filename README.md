# [Bole](https://getbole.com)

Bole is an interactive simulation/visualization of single-winner voting systems.

* **Robust:** Bole is able to simulate elections in real time as the environment is changing. It provides a way to adjust parameters (voter/candidate count, tactical voter chance, approval/support range, etc.) on the fly, giving the user total control.
* **Educational:** For those interested in the way of voting, it provides a boundless environment in which during experimentation, one can get a deep understanding about the different voting systems, their advantages and disadvantages.
* **Dynamic:** It provides an opportunity for the curious to automatize the process of voting method analysis by running multiple elections with the environment regenerated each time, and remembering the outcome of each.

It is recommended that you read the entire documentation in the main page (getbole.com) before
you proceed to try the program out.

We are not experts in social choice theory, we are just
highschool students. What you will see in the main page is not an expert advice but rather our
personal opinion. This is the first big project that we are doing together, so any feedback is appreciated.
