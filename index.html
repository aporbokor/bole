                The ideal electoral system is the one that straightforwardly and
                most accurately represents the preferences of voters. This is
                the goal every voting system strives for.
                <br />
                To represent the opinions of voters and candidates, an opinion
                plane is a must-have. Inside our simulation, the placement of a
                voter/candidate on the x and y axis represents their opinion,
                meaning the closer the voter is to a candidate, the more similar
                their opinions are.

                In our visualization the voters are marked with a smaller
                circle, and the candidates are marked with a bigger circle. If a
                voter has the same color as a candidate, it means that the voter
                voted for the candidate.

                However, this is (only) a visualization. In real life there is
                no such thing as 2 different and independent opinion axes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, in our simulation, voters know every candidate's exact
                opinion. That does not resemble a real life scenario, because
                sometimes it's in a candidate's best interest to lie about their
                opinion. So in today's world

            There are two ways a voter may vote: honestly, or tactically. The
            honest way is the intended way, the other is a consequence of the
            weaknesses of some voting systems.

                    <p class="section-starter-text">
                      Honest voters vote for the candidate with whom their views
                      align with the most. They do not consider the candidate's
                      chances of winning, and they do not change their
                      preference based on that. However, the design of many
                      voting systems prevents full expression of voter opinion.
                      As a result, voters may attempt to prevent undesired
                      outcomes rather than support positive outcomes. That is
                      precisely how they succumb to the dark side, namely:
                      tactical voting. They are represented with a non-filled
                      circle in the simulation.

                    Tactical voters, also called insincere or sophisticated
                    voters may support another candidate more strongly than
                    their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable
                    outcome. This situation occurs in elections with more than
                    two candidates. For example: a voter might gain a better
                    outcome by voting for a less preferred but more generally
                    popular candidate. There a lot of ways for a voter to vote
                    tactically, for example, they can rank an alternative lower
                    in hopes of defeating it. They are represented with a filled
                    circle in the visualization.
