            <p>
              If we want to visualize diferent voting systems, than first we are
              going to need a way to visualize the voters' and the candidates'
              opinions. To put it simply: in our visualization if two people are
              close to each other, than their opinion is similar. If they are
              far away, than their opinion is quite different. So we can place
              these lovely people into an opinion plane, where everyone's
              coordinate coresponds to their opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our visualization the voters are marked with a smaller circle,
              and the candidates are marked with a bigger circle.
            </p>
            <p>Take the following picture for example:</p>
            <p>
              There are 2 candidates and one voter in this picture. The orange
              voter is closer to the green candidate, than the pink candidate.
              This means that if the orange voter has to chose between these two
              candidates, it will chose green.
            </p>
            <p>
              So when there is an election every voters' dream is that, the
              candidate closest to it gets elected. Our goal is to make sure,
              that the candidate, who is the closest to the average opinion gets
              elected.

          Inside the simulation, the placement of a voter on the x and y axis
          represents their opinion. This stands for the candidates, too, meaning
          the closer the voter is to a candidate's position, the more similar
          their opinions are.
        </p>
        <p class="light-sec">
          There are two types of voters, tactical and honest ones. You can find
          detailed information about them below.

                Honest voters vote for the candidate with whom their views align
                with the most. They do not consider the candidate's chances of
                winning, and they do not change their preference based on that.
                They are represented with a lighter color in the simulation.

                may support another candidate more strongly than their sincere
                preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome. They are
                represented with a filled circle in the visualization.

        <h2>Voting Systems</h2>
        <p>
          The ideal electoral system is the one that straightforwardly and most
          accurately represents the preferences of voters. This is the goal
          every voting system strives for. You can find detailed information
          about the most used voting systems below. They are listed with
          increasing complexity.

              So let's take a look at the most known, most used voting system
              inthe word: plurarity voting. The rules are simple: every voter
              votes for exactly one candidate. We will count the total number of
              votes of each candidate. The candidate with the most votes wins.
              Pretty straightforward, isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with the simple case: only two candidates, 600 voters.
              We will color the voters based on who's name did they put an x
              next to.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this case as you can see pink wins. Let's see what happens if
              we add another candidate:

            Seems like the new candidate took the last place. Green still has as
            many votes as it has before. But look at pink's votecount. She only
            has 204 votes. So basicly this round, white joined the race, only to
            take last place, but the winner still changed. This doesn't make any
            sense. We clearly saw in the previous round, that more voters
            preferd pink over green.

            If we look at the pictures more closely, we'll see, that white
            literarly stole votes from pink. Those voters would have preferd
            pink more, than green, so they are prety unsatisfied about the
            outcome. This is called the spoiler effect. But there is still a way
            for pink to win. If among the white voters there are some strategic
            voters (indicated by larger strokeweight) then tey will vote for
            pink instead of white to prevent green from winning. Let's see this
            in action!

            <p>Here is a flowchart for tactical plurality voting:</p>
            <p>
              As you can see here, the strategic voters recognized that white
              has a pretty low chance of winning. So they voted for pink instead
              to help her win. And in the end, they succeded. So if voters know
              the chances of each candidate they can make decisions to prevent
              an undesirable outcome. But for this, they roughly need to know
              each candidates' chances. If they don't know or even worse,
              they've got a misinformation, than obiusly this is not going to
              work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wonder why plurarity voting in most cases leads to two party
              sytems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or
              candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is,
              receive a plurality), are elected. Sometimes, it is called
              first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting. This system is widely used, for
              example, in the United States.

          Approval voting systems are the first of multiple choice voting
          systems in our list. In this voting system basicly every voter can
          vote to as many candidates as they like. So for example if a voter
          would be satisfied if either ● candidate#1 or ● candidate#2 won the
          election, than the voter would vote for both ● candidate#1 and ●
          candidate#2. So it's almost like plurality, but here the voters'
          choices are not limited to one candidate.
        </p>

          <p>
            If we want to model this behavior, than we will need to define an
            approval range. If a candidate is inide of a voter's approval range,
            than the voter is going to vote for that candidate. If 2 candidates
            are inside the voter's approval range, than the voter is going to
            vote for those 2 canididates. In our idealized simulation every
            voter has the same approval range. So if we draw a circle around
            each candidate with the radius of the approval range, than every
            voter inside of that approval range is going to vote for that
            candidate. In the following example there are 3 candidates and 142
            voters.

            For example in this case the voter marked with a blue color will
            vote for white. This is due to the fact, that white is the only
            candidate inside the blue voter's approval radius. On the other end
            the red voter has 2 candidates inside the approval range. So when it
            comes to voting he is going to vote for both white and green. But as
            you can see there are some sad voters, for example the purple voter.
            No candidate is inside their approval range. In this case they are
            going to vote for the candidate closest to them. In this picture
            purple is going to vote for pink. Let's run the election to see what
            happens!

            It seems like white won. Notice that green is quite close to white.
            They have a similar opinion. So if this had been a plularity
            election, a spoiler effect would have occured and pink would have
            won. This is what would have happened if we had held a plularity
            election:

            Great, so approval fixes the spioler effect. So what else could
            cause a not win-worthy candidate to be chosen in an approval
            election? Well, the voters themself. If you look at the above
            approval voting results, you can see that green was qute close to
            winning. It was only 3 votes of. So what if 4 out of the voters who
            have voted for both green and white but had a little bit of
            preference to green decided not to vote for white, but only vote for
            green. So green, their most fauvorite has more chance to win. These
            are the strategic voters. Let's see what happens!

            It seems like white wins again. So what if even more voters beatryed
            white? Green would win again? That would mean that more white voters
            would need to beatray green in order for white to win. Let's see
            where this leads us!

          Seems like pink won. The voters beatrayed eachother so much, that they
          lowerd eachother's votecount so in the end pink was able to win. This
          is called the chicken dillema. In the extreme case where everyone is
          strategic everyone votes for one candidate. And that is nothing better
          than plurality voting.

        <p>
          Supplementary vote is a voting system where each voter submits their
          first and second fauvorite candidate. First we count the first choices
          and then we elliminate every candidate except for the top two based on
          the votecounts. And then we re-run the election counting every voter's
          first choices. But this time, if a voter's first choice is an already
          elliminated candidate, then we will count their second choice. The
          candidate with the most votes based on this votecounting will be the
          winner.

        <p>
          Instant-runoff voting(IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting
          counting method used in single-winner elections with more than two
          candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as preferential voting.
          Like any ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating supprot
          for only one candidate, voters can rank the candidates in order of
          preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice.
          If a candidate has more than 50% of the vote based on first-choices,
          that candidate wins. If not, the candidate with the fewest number of
          votes is eliminated, and the voters who chose that candidate as their
          first preference have their second preference votes considered, and
          added to the totals of the respective candidate's votes. This process
          is repeated until a candidate has more than half of the votes. If the
          field is reduced to two, an instant runoff is held, that allows the
          comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.Instant-runoff
          voting is used in national elections in several countries, political
          parties, and private associations. For example, choosing the Academy
          Award for Best Picture goes down like this.

          Coomb's method is a ranked preferentialvoting method quite similar to
          Instant Runoff. We initially count the top votes of each voters'
          ballot. After we have counted the votes we elliminate the candidate,
          who the majority of voters have ranked last (among non elliminated
          candidates)

        <h3 class="vs" translate="no">Borda counting</h3>
        <p>
          Borda counting is ranked preferential votingmethod. Each voter ranks
          the candidates in a way, that the candidate who they the most want to
          win takes up the first place. And the candidate, who they the least
          want to win takes up the last place. Based on this tier-list every
          candidate gets points. For every first place in a tier-list the
          candidate gets as many points, as many candidates there are. For every
          second place in a tier-list, the candidate gets one less points, than
          the total number of candidates and so on. Each candidate gets one
          point from each last place in a tier-list. In the end the candidate
          with the most points wins.
