	      <h2>Voter Types</h2>
	      <p>Inside the simulation, the placement of a voter on the x and y axis represents their opinion. This stands for the candidates, too, meaning the closer the voter is to a candidate's position, the more similar their opinions are.</p>
	      <p>There are two types of voters, strategic and honest ones. You can find detailed information about them below.</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><section class="docli">
	               <h3>Honest</h3>
	               <p>Honest voters vote for the candidate with whom their views align with the most. They do not consider the candidate's chances of winning, and they do not change their preference based on that. They are represented with a lighter color in the simulation.</p>

		      <h3>Strategic</h3>
		      <p>Strategic voters, also called insincere or sophisticated voters may support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome. They are represented with a darker color in the simulation.</p>

		<h2>Voting Systems</h2>
		<p>The ideal electoral system is the one that straightforwardly and most accurately represents the preferences of voters. This is the goal every voting system strives for. You can find detailed information about the most used voting systems below. They are listed with increasing complexity.</p>
		<ul>
  		<li><section class="docli">
  			<h3>Plurality</h3>
  			<p>Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is, receive a plurality), are elected. Sometimes, it is called first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting. This system is widely used, for example, in the United States.</p>

    		<h3>Instant-runoff</h3>
    		<p>Instant-runoff voting(IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting counting method used in single-winner elections with more than two candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as preferential voting. Like any ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating supprot for only one candidate, voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than 50% of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and the voters who chose that candidate as their first preference have their second preference votes considered, and added to the totals of the respective candidate's votes. This process is repeated until a candidate has more than half of the votes. If the field is reduced to two, an instant runoff is held, that allows the comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries, political parties, and private associations. For example, choosing the Academy Award for Best Picture goes down like this.</p>

        <h3>Coombs method</h3>
        <p>Coomb's method is a ranked preferentialvoting method quite similar to Instant Runoff. We initially count the top votes of each voters' ballot. After we have counted the votes we elliminate the candidate, who the majority of voters have ranked last (among non elliminated candidates)<p>
