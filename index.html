              If we want to visualize diferent voting systems, than first we are
              going to need a way to visualize the voters' and the candidates'
              opinions.
              Inside the simulation, the placement of a voter on the x and y axis
              represents their opinion. This stands for the candidates, too, meaning
              the closer the voter is to a candidate's position, the more similar
              their opinions are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or in other words: in our visualization if two people are close to each other, than their opinion is
              similar. If they are
              far away, than their opinion is quite different. So we can place
              these lovely people into an opinion plane, where everyone's
              coordinate coresponds to their opinion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img src="pictures/opinion_example_2.png" alt="opinion visualization example with arrows"
            class="canvas_img viewable_picture section-starter-picture">

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overflower-flex">
        <div>
          <p>
            In our visualization the voters are marked with a smaller circle,
            and the candidates are marked with a bigger circle.
          </p>
          <p>Take the following picture for example:</p>
          <p>
            There are 2 candidates and one voter in this picture. The orange
            voter is closer to the red candidate, than the white candidate.
            This means that if the orange voter has to chose between these two
            candidates, it will chose red.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when there is an election every voters' dream is that, the
            candidate closest to it gets elected. Our goal is to make sure,
            that the candidate, who is the closest to the average opinion gets
            elected.
          </p>

        <img src="pictures/opinion_example.png" alt="opinion visualization example"
          class="canvas_img viewable_picture" />

        <div>
          <p>But remember, this is just a simplified visualization. In real life there is no such thing as 2 different
            and independent oppinion axes. Also, in the visualization voters know every candidates' exact coordinates.
            This might not be
            that accurate in real life, because sometimes it's in a candidate's best interest to lie about their
            opinion. So in today's world <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">we don't know who we can
              trust</a>.</p>

            Approval voting systems are the first of multiple choice voting
            systems in our list. In this voting system basicly every voter can
            vote to as many candidates as they like. So for example if a voter
            would be satisfied if either ● candidate#1 or ● candidate#2 won the
            election, than the voter would vote for both ● candidate#1 and ●
            candidate#2. So it's almost like plurality, but here the voters'
            choices are not limited to one candidate.

            Instant-runoff voting(IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting
            counting method used in single-winner elections with more than two
            candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as preferential voting.
            Like any ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating supprot
            for only one candidate, voters can rank the candidates in order of
            preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice.
            If a candidate has more than 50% of the vote based on first-choices,
            that candidate wins. If not, the candidate with the fewest number of
            votes is eliminated, and the voters who chose that candidate as their
            first preference have their second preference votes considered, and
            added to the totals of the respective candidate's votes. This process
            is repeated until a candidate has more than half of the votes. If the
            field is reduced to two, an instant runoff is held, that allows the
            comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.Instant-runoff
            voting is used in national elections in several countries, political
            parties, and private associations. For example, choosing the Academy
            Award for Best Picture goes down like this.

            Coomb's method is a ranked preferentialvoting method quite similar to
            Instant Runoff. We initially count the top votes of each voters'
            ballot. After we have counted the votes we elliminate the candidate,
            who the majority of voters have ranked last (among non elliminated
            candidates). This process continues until there is only one candidate left.

            Borda counting is ranked preferential votingmethod. Each voter ranks
            the candidates in a way, that the candidate who they the most want to
            win takes up the first place. And the candidate, who they the least
            want to win takes up the last place. Based on this tier-list every
            candidate gets points. For every first place in a tier-list the
            candidate gets as many points, as many candidates there are. For every
            second place in a tier-list, the candidate gets one less points, than
            the total number of candidates and so on. Each candidate gets one
            point from each last place in a tier-list. In the end the candidate
            with the most points wins.
