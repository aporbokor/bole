        <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>If we want to visualize diferent voting systems, than first we are going to need a way to visualize the voters' and the candidates' opinions. To put it simply: in our visualization if two people are close to each other, than their opinion is similar. If they are far away, than teir opinion is quite different. So we can place these lovely people into an opinion plane, where everyone's coordinate coresponds to their opinion.</p>
        <p>In our visualization the voters are marked with a smaller circle, and the candidates are marked with a bigger circle.</p>
        <p>Take the following picture for example:</p>
        <img src='pictures/opinion_example.png', class='canvas_img'></img>
        <p>There are 2 candidates and one voter in this picture. The orange voter is closer to the green candidate, than the pink candidate. This means that if the orange voter has to chose between these two candidates, it will chose green.</p>
        <p>So when there is an election every voters' dream is that, the candidate closest to it gets elected. Our goal is to make sure, that the candidate, who is the closest to the average opinion gets elected.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="voter_types" class="doc">
	      <h2>Voter Types</h2>
	      <p>Inside the simulation, the placement of a voter on the x and y axis represents their opinion. This stands for the candidates, too, meaning the closer the voter is to a candidate's position, the more similar their opinions are.</p>
	      <p>There are two types of voters, strategic and honest ones. You can find detailed information about them below.</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><section class="docli">
	               <h3>Honest</h3>
	               <p>Honest voters vote for the candidate with whom their views align with the most. They do not consider the candidate's chances of winning, and they do not change their preference based on that. They are represented with a lighter color in the simulation.</p>
			      </section></li>
			      <li><section class="docli">
		      <h3>Strategic</h3>
		      <p>Strategic voters, also called insincere or sophisticated voters may support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome. They are represented with a darker outline in the simulation.</p>

		<h2>Voting Systems</h2>
		<p>The ideal electoral system is the one that straightforwardly and most accurately represents the preferences of voters. This is the goal every voting system strives for. You can find detailed information about the most used voting systems below. They are listed with increasing complexity.</p>
		<ul>

  		<li><section class="docli">
  			<h3>Plurality</h3>
        <p>So let's take a look at the most known, most used voting system inthe word: plurarity voting. The rules are simple: every voter votes for exactly one candidate. We will count the total number of votes of each candidate. The candidate with the most votes wins. Pretty straightforward, isn't it? </p>
        <p>Let's start with the simple case: only two candidates, 600 voters. We will color the voters based on who's name did they put an x next to.</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border ">
          <img src='pictures/plurality/plurality_first.png' class='canvas_img'></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border ">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 381</p><progress class="progress_" value="381" max="600">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 219</p><progress class="progress_" value="219" max="600">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>In this case as you can see pink wins. Let's see what happens if we add another candidate:</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src='pictures/plurality/plurality_second.png' class='canvas_img'></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border ">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 219</p><progress class="progress_" value="219" max="600">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 204</p><progress class="progress_" value="204" max="600">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 177</p><progress class="progress_" value="177" max="600">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>Seems like the new candidate took the last place. Green still has as many votes as it has before. But look at pink's votecount. She only has 204 votes. So basicly this round, white joined the race, only to take last place, but the winner still changed. This doesn't make any sense. We clearly saw in the previous round, that more voters preferd pink over green.</p>

        <p>If we look at the pictures more closely, we'll see, that white literarly stole votes from pink. Those voters would have preferd pink more, than green, so they are prety unsatisfied about the outcome. This is called the spoiler effect. But there is still a way for pink to win. If among the white voters there are some strategic voters (indicated by larger strokeweight) then tey will vote for pink instead of white to prevent green from winning. Let's see this in action!</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src='pictures/plurality/plurality_third.png' class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 240</p><progress class="progress_" value="240" max="600">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 219</p><progress class="progress_" value="219" max="600">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 141</p><progress class="progress_" value="141" max="600">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see here, the strategic voters recognized that white has a pretty low chance of winning. So they voted for pink instead to help her win. And in the end, they succeded. So if voters know the chances of each candidate they can make decisions to prevent an undesirable outcome. But for this, they roughly need to know each candidates' chances. If they don't know or even worse, they've got a misinformation, than obiusly this is not going to work.</p>
        <p>I wonder why plurarity voting in most cases leads to two party sytems.</p>
        <p>Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is, receive a plurality), are elected. Sometimes, it is called first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting. This system is widely used, for example, in the United States.</p>

  		<li><section class="docli">
    		<h3>Approval</h3>
    		<p>Approval voting systems are the first of multiple choice voting systems in our list. In this voting system basicly every voter can vote to as many candidates as they like. So for example if a voter would be satisfied if either ● candidate#1 or ● candidate#2 won the election, than the voter would vote for both ● candidate#1 and ● candidate#2. So it's almost like plurality, but here the voters' choices are not limited to one candidate.</p>
        <p>If we want to model this behavior, than we will need to define an approval range. If a candidate is inide of a voter's approval range, than the voter is going to vote for that candidate. If 2 candidates are inside the voter's approval range, than the voter is going to vote for those 2 canididates. In our idealized simulation every voter has the same approval range. So if we draw a circle around each candidate with the radius of the approval range, than every voter inside of that approval range is going to vote for that candidate. In the following example there are 3 candidates and 142 voters.</p>

        <img src="pictures/approval/approval_introduction.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
        <p>For example in this case the voter marked with a blue color will vote for white. This is due to the fact, that white is the only candidate inside the blue voter's approval radius. On the other end the red voter has 2 candidates inside the approval range. So when it comes to voting he is going to vote for both white and green. But as you can see there are some sad voters, for example the purple voter. No candidate is inside their approval range. In this case they are going to vote for the candidate closest to them. In this picture purple is going to vote for pink. Let's run the election to see what happens!</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src="pictures/approval/approval_first.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 60</p><progress class="progress_" value="60" max="142">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 57</p><progress class="progress_" value="57" max="142">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 53</p><progress class="progress_" value="53" max="142">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>It seems like white won. Notice that green is quite close to white. They have a similar opinion. So if this had been a plularity election, a spoiler effect would have occured and pink would have won. This is what would have happened if we had held a plularity election:</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src="pictures/approval/plurarity_instead_approval.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 53</p><progress class="progress_" value="53" max="142">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 52</p><progress class="progress_" value="52" max="142">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 37</p><progress class="progress_" value="37" max="142">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>Great, so approval fixes the spioler effect. So what else could cause a not win-worthy candidate to be chosen in an approval election? Well, the voters themself. If you look at the above approval voting results, you can see that green was qute close to winning. It was only 3 votes of. So what if 4 out of the voters who have voted for both green and white but had a little bit of preference to green decided not to vote for white, but only vote for green. So green, their most fauvorite has more chance to win. These are the strategic voters. Let's see what happens!</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src="pictures/approval/approval_second.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 57</p><progress class="progress_" value="57" max="142">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 56</p><progress class="progress_" value="56" max="142">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 53</p><progress class="progress_" value="53" max="142">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see these 4 strategic voters have succesfully made green win by beatraying white. I wonder what would happen if some of the white voters beatrayed green...</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src="pictures/approval/approval_third.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 56</p><progress class="progress_" value="56" max="142">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 54</p><progress class="progress_" value="54" max="142">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 53</p><progress class="progress_" value="53" max="142">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>It seems like white wins again. So what if even more voters beatryed white? Green would win again? That would mean that more white voters would need to beatray green in order for white to win. Let's see where this leads us!</p>

        <div class="voteresult accent_border">
          <img src="pictures/approval/approval_fourth.png" class="canvas_img"></img>
          <div class="voting_result accent_border">Voting results:<div><div class="place_div">1st<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);"><p style="color: rgb(238, 165, 165);">● candidate#1|votes: 53</p><progress class="progress_" value="53" max="142">● candidate#1|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">2nd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 238, 219);">● candidate#2|votes: 52</p><progress class="progress_" value="52" max="142">● candidate#2|votes: </progress></div></div><div class="place_div">3rd<div class="candidate_p" style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);"><p style="color: rgb(143, 203, 155);">● candidate#0|votes: 37</p><progress class="progress_" value="37" max="142">● candidate#0|votes: </progress></div></div></div></div>
        </div>
        <p>Seems like pink won. The voters beatrayed eachother so much, that they lowerd eachother's votecount so in the end pink was able to win. This is called the chicken dillema. In the extreme case where everyone is strategic everyone votes for one candidate. And that is nothing better than plurality voting.</p>

      <li><section class="docli">
        <h3>Borda counting</h3>
        <p>Borda counting is ranked preferential votingmethod. Each voter ranks the candidates in a way, that the candidate who they the most want to win takes up the first place. And the candidate, who they the least want to win takes up the last place. Based on this tier-list every candidate gets points. For every first place in a tier-list the candidate gets as many points, as many candidates there are. For every second place in a tier-list, the candidate gets one less points, than the total number of candidates and so on. Each candidate gets one point from each last place in a tier-list. In the end the candidate with the most points wins.</p>
      </section></li>

  		<li><section class="docli">
    		<h3>Instant-runoff</h3>
    		<p>Instant-runoff voting(IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting counting method used in single-winner elections with more than two candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as preferential voting. Like any ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating supprot for only one candidate, voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than 50% of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and the voters who chose that candidate as their first preference have their second preference votes considered, and added to the totals of the respective candidate's votes. This process is repeated until a candidate has more than half of the votes. If the field is reduced to two, an instant runoff is held, that allows the comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries, political parties, and private associations. For example, choosing the Academy Award for Best Picture goes down like this.</p>

      <li><section class="docli">
        <h3>Coombs method</h3>
        <p>Coomb's method is a ranked preferentialvoting method quite similar to Instant Runoff. We initially count the top votes of each voters' ballot. After we have counted the votes we elliminate the candidate, who the majority of voters have ranked last (among non elliminated candidates)<p>
