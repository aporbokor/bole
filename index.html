          This is a visualization of the current (single-winner) voting systems
          of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find detailed explanation about them below, extended with each
          system's flaws, and strategies to combat it.

      <section class="documentation information primary">
        <h2>information</h2>
        <p>
          The canvas's voters's x and y coordinates are representing the voters
          (and the candidates's) opininons.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means, that the closer two voters are on the canvas, their
          opinions are more similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in every voter's interest that the winner of the election is the
          candidate that is closest to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to create a voting system, where the chosen candidate is
          the closest possible to everyone.
        </p>

      <section class="documentation usage accent">
        <h2>usage</h2>
        <p>
          You can choose the voting method from the drop-down list at the
          simulation page.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of voters: the honest ones and the strategic ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honest voters: They vote for the candidate they would like the most to
          win, even if that candidate only has a marginal chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategic voters: They vote knowing the voting system, and they give
          an opinion which is not necessarily honest, but which gives a bigger
          chance for a candidate ideal for them. They are highlighted with the a
          darker color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, for example, in the case of an approval voting, if everyone
          is strategic, then the outcome is worse for everyone, than it would've
          been if everyone was honest in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The canvas is re-generatable, in which case every voter and candidate
          disappears, and they can reappear in regards of the values the user
          inputs to the sliders.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select voters or candidates by right-clicking on them, in
          which case a red line will highlight it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see detailed information about selected voters or candidates
          in the selected part.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may change their name, color, properties, their strategic-ness, or
          delete them there.
        </p>

      <section class="documentation final primary">
        <h2>final</h2>
        <p>
          In some cases, it does not matter if a voter is strategic or honest,
          sometimes honesty is the best strategy one can employ.
        </p>

          simulation if you want, by clicking on the SIMULATE button on the top
          of the page.
