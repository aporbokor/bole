            This is a visualization of the current (single-winner) voting
            systems of the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can find detailed explanation about them below, extended with
            each system's flaws, and strategies to combat it.

        <h2>information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The canvas's voters's x and y coordinates are representing the
            voters (and the candidates's) opininons.
          </li>
          <li>
            This means, that the closer two voters are on the canvas, their
            opinions are more similar.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is in every voter's interest that the winner of the election is
            the candidate that is closest to him.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our goal is to create a voting system, where the chosen candidate is
            the closest possible to everyone.
          </li>

        <h2>usage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can choose the voting method from the drop-down list at the
            simulation page.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are two types of voters: the honest ones and the strategic
            ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Honest voters: They vote for the candidate they would like the most
            to win, even if that candidate only has a marginal chance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strategic voters: They vote knowing the voting system, and they give
            an opinion which is not necessarily honest, but which gives a bigger
            chance for a candidate ideal for them. They are highlighted with the
            a darker color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, for example, in the case of an approval voting, if
            everyone is strategic, then the outcome is worse for everyone, than
            it would've been if everyone was honest in the first place.
          </li>
          <li>
            The canvas is re-generatable, in which case every voter and
            candidate disappears, and they can reappear in regards of the values
            the user inputs to the sliders.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can select voters or candidates by right-clicking on them, in
            which case a red line will highlight it.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can see detailed information about selected voters or candidates
            in the selected part.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may change their name, color, properties, their strategic-ness,
            or delete them there.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="documentation">
        <h2>final</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In some cases, it does not matter if a voter is strategic or honest,
            sometimes honesty is the best strategy one can employ.
